## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Evolving-sun seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to the repository maintainers:

- **Email**: [security@teamintelxsel.com](mailto:security@teamintelxsel.com)
- **Alternative**: Open a [Security Advisory](https://github.com/Teamintelxsel/Evolving-sun/security/advisories/new) on GitHub

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the issue and determine its impact and severity.

3. **Updates**: We will keep you informed about the progress of fixing the vulnerability.

4. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will:
   - Release a security update
   - Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
   - Credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

### Security Update Process

When a security vulnerability is confirmed:

1. We will develop a fix and test it thoroughly
2. We will prepare a security advisory
3. We will release a patched version
4. We will publish the security advisory with details about the vulnerability and the fix

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

### Policy

We follow the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/Executive+Summary).
