## Entries

### 2025-10-01
- **Workflow Repair Initiative (Issue #4)**: Addressed critical workflow failures
  - Root cause identified: Empty `.github/workflows/main.yml` file causing all runs to fail
  - Created comprehensive `WORKFLOW_STATUS.md` for transparent documentation
  - Implemented functional CI workflow with repository validation
  - Workflow now performs essential health checks:
    * Validates presence of required files (README, LICENSE, KNOWLEDGE_BASE, etc.)
    * Checks documentation structure
    * Verifies workflow file integrity
  - All changes follow community-driven principles outlined in KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
  - Agent: Copilot
