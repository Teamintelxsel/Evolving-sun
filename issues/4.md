### Root Cause Analysis Completed ✅
The primary workflow failure has been identified:
- **Issue**: The `.github/workflows/main.yml` file was completely empty
- **Impact**: All workflow runs failed with no jobs to execute
- **Affected Period**: Multiple workflow runs from 2025-09-07 to 2025-10-01

### Actions Taken ✅
1. **Created WORKFLOW_STATUS.md**: Comprehensive documentation of workflow issues, root causes, and resolution plan
2. **Implemented Functional Workflow**: New CI workflow with:
   - Repository structure validation
   - Essential file checks (README, LICENSE, KNOWLEDGE_BASE, etc.)
   - Documentation directory verification
   - Workflow integrity validation
   - Clear, community-friendly steps

3. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added detailed entries to `library/CHANGE_LOG.md`
   - Documented resolution progress in this file
   - Maintained transparency throughout

### Alignment with Project Principles ✅
All fixes follow the community-driven approach:
- **Transparency**: Full documentation of issues and solutions
- **Community Input**: Changes are open for review and feedback
- **Collaborative**: Workflow designed for easy community contribution
- **Continuous Improvement**: Foundation for future enhancements

### Next Steps
- [ ] Community review and feedback on workflow implementation
- [ ] Gather suggestions for additional checks and validations
