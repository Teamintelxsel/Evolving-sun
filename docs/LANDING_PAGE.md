## Problem Section

### Headline
## The Problem: Your AI is Running Wild

### Body Copy
You've deployed AI agents to automate your workflows. But do you really know what they're doing?

**Without comprehensive auditing:**
- ❌ Quality issues discovered too late
- ❌ No visibility into agent behavior
- ❌ Compliance and governance gaps
- ❌ Manual reviews don't scale
- ❌ 85% of AI projects fail

**The hidden costs:**
```
💸 $2.6M average cost of AI system failure
⏰ 40% of dev time wasted on manual checks  
🐛 3-week average delay to detect problems
📋 Regulatory fines and reputation damage
```

### Callout Quote
> "We were flying blind with our AI agents until Evolving-sun gave us complete visibility and control."

## FAQ Section

### Headline
## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is this different from CodeQL or SonarQube?**

A: Those are great tools for static analysis. We complement them by adding an LLM-powered semantic layer that catches issues automated tools miss. Plus, we specifically focus on AI agent systems with conversation tracking and quality verification.

**Q: What if I already have quality tools?**

A: Perfect! We integrate with your existing stack. Most customers keep their current tools and add Evolving-sun for the LLM verification layer that doesn't exist elsewhere.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**

A: Typical deployment is 1-2 weeks for initial setup. Full integration happens over 60-90 days with our support.

**Q: What's the learning curve?**

A: If you know Git and CI/CD, you're 80% there. Most teams are productive within a week. We provide training and ongoing support.

**Q: Can it handle our scale?**

A: Yes. Our architecture supports 100+ developer teams and scales horizontally. Tested with repositories up to 10,000 files.

**Q: What about data privacy?**

A: Your code stays in your infrastructure. Enterprise tier includes on-premises deployment. All data handling is GDPR compliant.

**Q: What's the ROI timeline?**

A: Most customers break even within 6 months. Full ROI (10x) typically in 12-18 months based on productivity gains and risk reduction.
