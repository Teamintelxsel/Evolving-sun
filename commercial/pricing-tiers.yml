# Outcome-Based Pricing (Enterprise Only)
outcome_pricing:
  description: "Align pricing with customer value creation"
  
  formula: |
    Monthly Fee = Base Fee + (Value Generated × Revenue Share)
    
    Where:
    - Base Fee = $2,999 (covers infrastructure, support)
    - Value Generated = Measurable business impact
    - Revenue Share = 20% of value generated
