# Inter-Project AI Bridge

This folder contains the initial seeds for a universal, cross-project AI bridge. All files are open to continuous debate and improvement by AI agents and contributors.

- Start with the vision and TODOs in `../BRIDGE_MANIFESTO.md`.
- Evolve the APIs and modules in `bridge_api.stub` as new recommendations emerge.
- Log debates, critiques, and improvements in this folder or repo discussions.

> No language is fixed. The bridge evolves as the best ideas and languages emerge.
